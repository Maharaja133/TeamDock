A full-stack SaaS platform that allows admins and managers to manage employees, assign roles, and organize company structure efficiently.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React (Vite)** – Fast and modern React tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI styling.
- **React Icons** – Used for clean and accessible iconography.
- **Axios** – Handles HTTP requests to the backend API.

### Backend:
- **Node.js + Express** – RESTful API server.
- **MongoDB Atlas** – Cloud-based NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB to define schemas/models.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** – Used for secure authentication.
- **bcryptjs** – Password hashing.

### Deployment:
- **Render** – Hosts the backend API.
- **Vercel** – Hosts the frontend (React app).
- **MongoDB Atlas** – Remote database for persistent storage.

## Development Approach

- **MERN Stack** was selected to enable fast, flexible development using JavaScript across both frontend and backend.
- **Role-based access control** is implemented using middleware (`protect`, `admin`) to restrict routes appropriately.
- **Modular design**: Each route, controller, and model is structured cleanly for scalability.
- **Reusable Axios instance** is configured with interceptors to handle auth tokens and errors globally.
- **Form handling** is done via controlled components in React with basic validation.

## Key Decisions

- **Tailwind CSS** was chosen for styling to enable fast, consistent UI without writing custom CSS.
- **Render** was selected over Heroku for the backend due to generous free tier and automatic GitHub deployments.
- **Vercel** was chosen for the frontend due to its seamless integration with React and automatic CI/CD.
- Environment variables (`VITE_API_URL`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`) are configured securely per deployment platform.
